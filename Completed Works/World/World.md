Tomorrow's Reflection begins during modern-day earth. Society was much like our own until one day a cataclysmic event called the [[History & Timeline|Solar Disaster]] wiped out 70% of the population. This event caused a phenomena called mana to enter the body of the remaining humans, giving them [[Magic|magical abilities]] and allowing them a protective barrier that can allow their body to take much more damage before reaching critical condition. 

Some humans also evolved into a new species of human, called the [[Metasoma]]. [[Metasoma]] are humans who were imbued with magic, and based on the circumstances and environment around them, evolved into new species of human, with traits pertaining to said environment such as having animalistic traits or traits of the terrain around them. 

Humans were not the only thing to evolve however, [[Magic|mana]] also affected the wildlife and even the very environment of the earth, [[Resources|plants]] and [[Resources|natural resources]] became imbued with magic too, giving them unique properties and mutations. Many animals went through changes thanks to [[Magic|mana]], some undergoing changes in intelligence and body, becoming creatures known as [[Lusii & Belua|Belua]] while others became mutated and became [[Lusii & Belua|Lusii]], creatures that only have instincts to hunt and kill, even when it does not benefit them. 

Not long after the [[History & Timeline|Solar Disaster]], a powerful human named [[Gaia Roths]], used her immense power to join the worlds continents together into one large-scale continent called [[Drasil]], and declared herself to worlds new leader, starting the infamous [[Roths Family]] lineage.

The people of [[Drasil]] would make many leaps in technological progress, introducing vast amounts of magic [[Technology|technology]] into the world. On top of this, many mysterious [[Relics]] have been found throughout Drasil in history, each with different meanings and stories.

Over the years, many regions would also come to believe in many different faiths, [[Faiths|religions]] and deities.
