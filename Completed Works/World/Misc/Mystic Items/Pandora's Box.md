Pandora's Box is a relic with a prominent history throughout [[Tomorrow's Reflection]].

# History
Pandora's Box first appeared after the [[Duel of Existence]] took place. Used by [[Red]] as a means to seal away [[Mayan]], it was then buried away in a temple, found deep underground in old Mexico. 
The box was later discovered by [[Gaia Roths]], who opened the box, unleashing [[Magic]] into the world by causing the great power within to blast into the sun, causing the [[History & Timeline|Solar Disaster]]. Gaia was able to close the box, only releasing a fraction of the power kept within. 
Gaia kept this box, locking it deep within the [[Glaspalast]] and refusing to touch it.
The Roths lineage left the box alone for several generations, fearful of the power within, until it was opened once more by [[Athena|Athena Roth's]], who released [[Pandora]] alongside it. Much power is still contained within the box.
Not long after departing from the Roths, Pandora would return in secret to reclaim the box, where it now remains on her person.

# Functions
Pandora's Box has many functions.
It is commonly used by Pandora to channel her power, by using it as a conduit of sorts, though this takes a great deal of concentration. 
The box also appears to contain a whole other world inside, which Pandora describes as "chaotic".
