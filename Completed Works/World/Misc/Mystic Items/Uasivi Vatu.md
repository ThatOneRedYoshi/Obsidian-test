The Uasivi Vatu is a mystical relic found in [[Tomorrow's Reflection]].

# Appearance
The Uasivi Vatu is a glowing red orb made of seemingly crystal-like material that glows and pulses a bright red colour. It is perfectly rounded and smooth to the touch, having a mysterious flowing liquid subtly flowing around inside.

# History
The Uasivi Vatu was discovered by the [[Sirens]] shortly after the [[History & Timeline|Solar Disaster]]. It was taken back by the Sirens and served as a great help for them by keeping away Lusii and other dangerous sea life.
A shrine was built for the Uasivi Vatu, and the Sirens pray to it regularly.

# Functions
The exact origins and function of the Uasivi Vatu are unknown, however it has been shown to have the magical ability to deter animals and creatures, much in the same way as [[Magic|Life]] magic.
