The Magic Gate system was a system designed and left behind by [[Gaia Roths]]. It is a large archway with a thing layer of magic extending through it that acts in a similar way to how a portal might work. They are typically located in city centres or city entrances.

# Functions
The Magic Gate system is a large gate system that connects across all cities within the [[Collective Capital]]. They function through using remnants of [[Magic|Order]] magic to change the physical position of those who enter its field and transports them to a vast network of gates that each have a corresponding exit point in the capital.
The energy used to power this system is a remnant of Gaia's own mana that she imbued into the device at its creation, a power which can not be refilled by even another member of the Roths family, thus meaning it cannot be replenished, despite this however, the magic gates supply of mana has barely been consumed at all, meaning that the gates should continue to function long into the foreseeable future.
The magic gates have a capacity of two thousand people at a time, though people only tend to spend a minute or two inside at a time so travel through the gates is higher efficient with short traffic times.

# Laws
Use of the Magic Gates system requires identification before entry, which is checked by security, this process is near seamless as it is done during the queueing period of entry. 

Entry is free for all citizens, however if someone is transferring a high quantity of goods they will be required to pay a small fee in order to take them through with them, as this costs space and may mean less people can enter at once.

During none-peak hours, the transporting of goods is free, however must undergo a larger inspection to prevent illegal smuggling of goods.
