[[Tomorrow's Reflection]] has an expansive list of historical events that shaped the world we know today

# Timeline of Events

## Before Time
Before the start of time, the only perceived existence was a sort of [[None-Physical Dimension|soul world]] where nothing physical existed and only souls existed. This world was built purely on thoughts, the people here could perceive their version of "reality" through thoughts.
One day, one of the wisest souls living in this dimension by the name of [[Phoenix]], would imagine a concept of the world we know today. A being named [[The Balance|"The Balance"]] would approach Phoenix, offering to make his idea a reality, to which he agreed, thus sparking the beginning of time.

## Birth of Phoenix (4000BC)
[[Phoenix|Phoenix's]] physical form was granted to him at around 4000BC, a time which he perceived as the beginning of all things. Human civilization was just getting its start and Phoenix was a wanderer, helping people as he went. Eventually Phoenix discovered that he was not brought into being at the beginning of time and sought out the universe's [[The Balance|"creator"]] for answers.

Two other beings came into existence around this time, [[Mayan]] and [[Chronos]], two beings that embodied space and time respectively. Both of these beings remained resting for several centuries.

## Duel of Existence (200AD)
Around 200AD, a great battle with ensue between [[Chronos]]/[[Mayan]] and [[The Balance]]. Their fight would last for weeks, before finally ending in victory for Chronos and Mayan.
The follow up to this event would be that humanity would begin to fear powers that are higher than them, and using this fear, a mysterious girl named [[Red|"Red"]] sealed away Mayan inside of a powerful box, and scared Chronos into hiding.
After all of this, humanity would come to forget magic over time, and the names of those ancient beings would sink into legend.

## Solar Disaster (2030AD)
Taking place in the year 2030, the Solar Disaster is the historical event that completely altered the world as we know it.

One day, when an archaeologist by the name of [[Gaia Roths]] was exploring ancient ruins in the country we now know as old Mexico, she stumbled upon an ancient temple buried deep underground and traversed through it to its core, where she discovered then [[Pandora's Box]]. Upon opening this box, a huge surge of power exploding outwards, lighting up the sky with a blinding ray of energy. This ray crashed into the sun, causing a solar event that exerted vast amounts of radioactive energy. This energy, carrying the power within the box, swiftly flew back to the earth, centralising on the point the box was opened. This event caused billions to die, and the remaining population gained powers that can only be described as magic.

## Origin of Drasil (0NE)
Shortly after attaining mass power [[Gaia Roths]] used it to conjoin the entire world into one large continent called Drasil, turning it into a giant floating island, suspended on the water by magic. She used her power and influence to cause mas fear amongst the people, causing them to come to her for aid and treat her like a god. With power to her head she got to work creating a glorious empire, becoming known as the capital. This began the start of a new age, referred to as NE (Short for "New Era").

## The Great Roths Massacres (183NE)
A few years into her rules, [[Stheno Roths]] would begin a "War against evil", where she vowed to purge out all oppositions to the Collective Capital, and to force the entire world under one rule. Through this ruse she began attacking sections of [[The Country]] that surrounded the Capital. The people of the Country came to name this "The Great Roths Massacres", as they were severely outnumbered and overpowered.
