The None-Physical Dimension is an alternative reality in [[Tomorrow's Reflection]].

A world where nothing physical exists, nothing can be perceived except one's own thoughts. This realm is shrouded in mystery, and its people here, the [[Manifestation|Manifestation's]], are individual consciousnesses that can connect to and interact with one another.
