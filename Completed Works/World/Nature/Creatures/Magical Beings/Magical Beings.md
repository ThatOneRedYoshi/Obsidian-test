Magical Beings are a type of [[Living Creatures|living creature]] that is made purely of [[Magic|magic]].

Often being creations of magic wielders, Magical Beings are creatures created with magic but born with souls. They are a rare case, as many magic familiars are soulless and mindless, it takes a great deal of [[Magic|mana]] to create and maintain a Magical Being.

Magical Beings are living creatures made of magic that have souls, consciousness and intelligence. If they are created by a magic wielder, the aforementioned traits will persist through the mana of the wielder, so even if they are dismissed their traits can be reconstructed with ease.

Other forms of Magical Beings also exist, they can be born naturally when a high concentration of mana is dispersed, and will persist until that mana is drained completely, however, can extend their lifespans by consuming more mana
