Sirens are a species of [[Metasoma]] that live exclusively in the [[New Wave Ocean]] region.

# Overview
Sirens are a self-sufficient species that first began to live within the New Wave Ocean region shortly after the [[History & Timeline|forming of Drasil.]] They have evolved their bodies to live nearly exclusively underwater, allowing them to travel fast through the waves. Nearly all known Sirens live in [[Koro' Ni Vale]], a city located under the waters of New Wave Ocean, and they are very mistrusting of other species.

# Appearance
Sirens are easily recognized by their fish-like tails, taking the place of their waist dog, these tails allow for quick manoeuvres in the water at the cost of their ability to walk. These tails are scaled, much like almost any fish found in the sea, they are rough to the touch and are rather resilient to damage. The fins of their tail are soft and thin, they are very delicate but can often regrow quickly if the damage done is not too severe. Their other notable feature is their sharp triangular teeth, not too dissimilar from shark teeth. The remaining parts of their body are human in appearance, though they do have harder skin than regular humans.

# Abilities
Sirens have a plethora of useful abilities that help them live safely underwater.
Sirens are able to breathe underwater through magic, inhaling the oxygen within the water without the water itself entering their lungs, they manage to keep water out with internal mana
They are also adept swimmers, able to travel up to 23Km/h through the water using their tails to propel them.
Most Sirens are also able to communicate with most sea life, though the usefulness of this varies based on the intelligence of the sea creature, they can typically converse and understand creatures like sharks, whales and dolphins.
