Metasoma are a sub-species of human that have evolved through [[Magic]], much like [[Lusii & Belua]]. 

Metasoma came about when magic altered the genetic structure of a person or group of people, causing their body to adapt more or connect to the environment around them. Oftentimes Metasoma will exhibit animalistic traits, or traits related to their natural environment.

Metasoma are distinct enough in genetic structure to call each of them an individual species, only retaining loose similarities to humans, however, they do often exhibit intelligence and emotions in the same way as a human, leading many to refuse to treat them differently.
