# What is a Living Creature?
Creatures are defined as any being that has lifeforce and a soul. Lifeforce is the foundation of individuality and so to be considered a living creature one must have a soul and lifeforce. One can have one without having the other, for example many zombies do not have a lifeforce however they do carry with them the souls of their previous life, this is one example of a being that is not counted as a living creature.


# Types of Creatures
In addition to the above, creatures affected by magic fall under two different categories

## Lusii and Belua
Belua is the typical term for animal-like creatures. Much like animals of the old world, Belua act on their instincts to survive, this means that they do things such as; hunt, retaliate, bond, etc. Belua is a term primarily used to differentiate animals from the creatures that have been substantially affected by magic altering their genes.

Lusii are also genetically altered animals however they do not act on the same instincts as Belua. Lusii are violent by nature and attack anything that isn’t a Lusii on sight. How they differentiate themselves is still unknown.

On top of animalistic creatures there are other types of living creatures which will be described below.

## Spirits
Spirits are defined as any creature that embodies, represents or otherwise possesses the soul of another living creature. For one of these to still be considered a creature it must also hold some form of lifeforce, so while zombies carry the souls of their former selves, some zombies do not have lifeforce.

## Magical Beings
Magical Beings are defined as any being made from magic or that require magic as an energy source to stay alive. Creatures of this sort generally do not exist in natural circumstances and are more often than not conjured by people using magic. There are occasional exceptions to this rule, however, though insufficient data exists to make a full conclusion of the topic.

## None Living Beings
None-Living Beings are a special case, very few of them exist and they often act as a force that exists without a [[Lifeforce]] and sometimes even without a soul, but is still conscious or mobile through some method, the exacts of this are hard to define as very little study has been done on the topic.
