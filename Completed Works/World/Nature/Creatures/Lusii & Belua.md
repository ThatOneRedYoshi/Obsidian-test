With the introduction of magic, came the introduction of many wonderous, magical and mystical beasts. Many animals became infused with magic, evolving their bodies and altering their brains in ways that could be described both as a deformation and an evolution.

These evolved creatures, much like humans, gained the abilities to use both [[Magic|mana and magic]]. These creatures were dubbed Belua and Lusii respectively.

# Belua
