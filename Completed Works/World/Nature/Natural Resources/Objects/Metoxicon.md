Metoxicon is a man-made resource, commonly used in hot regions for their heat absorbent properties. By imbuing small amounts of magic into the surface of [[Minotaurs (Iratus Taur)|Minotaur]] flesh, it will turn into a soft material that appears like leather. Hanging this material with rope and stretching it out causes it to absorb heat, this heat can be used for both powering machinery or stored for use during winters.

The people of Phoeba first discovered this material during the building of [[Folia]]. It originated from a concept for a heating device, using the Minotaurs high sensitivity as a basis for a power source. Instead, they discovered that the when infusing mana into their flesh, it would absorb all heat from the surrounding areas. This material was then used as the primary heating function in Folia, placing bulks of it outside of the city, and storing heat that can be then brought back to the city and extracted throughout the lower levels in order to heat up the areas not catching sun.
