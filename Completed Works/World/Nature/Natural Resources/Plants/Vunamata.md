Vunamata is a parasitic mushroom that grows in [[New Wave Ocean|Maei]]. Vunamata act as sponges for [[Magic]], they sprout in areas that contain [[Resources|Mana Veins]], but require a high level of concentrated magic to sprout. Vunamata survive by consuming the mana from nearby plants and draining them until they die out. They also consume mana from Mana Veins, but only do this after they have ran out of plants to consume the mana of. Additionally, Vunamata let off toxic fumes that drain the mana of any creatures that breathe it in.

Vunamata were first discovered by the people of [[Phoeba]] during an expedition to the [[Old World Island]]. Little is known about them, but they managed to prevent anyone from successfully reaching the island. Later, studies were performed by experts in plant biology, while information was discovered, none of the biologists survived the study.
