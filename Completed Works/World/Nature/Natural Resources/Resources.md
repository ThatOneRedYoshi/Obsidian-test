[[Magic]] has not only been imbued into creatures, many objects and plants also absorbed mana, giving them various unique properties.

[[Magic|Mana]] can be imbued naturally into resources or manually by a person, the mana used for manual imbuement must be sourced from another deposit, as human mana is not compatible with inanimate objects.

There are two types of imbued objects, plants and objects.

# Objects
Many natural resources in Drasil have been or can be imbued with mana. Imbuing typically gives objects unique properties, these properties can vary with countless possibilities, each functioning on a case by case basis.

# Plants
Plants in Drasil which are imbued with magic exhibit similar traits to [[Lusii & Belua]], causing mutations to genes and granted the plants magic abilities. Though plants do exhibit behaviour that may be perceived as sentient, they do not have consciousness nor souls and are not considered living.

# Mana Veins
Mana Veins are a concept first discovered by [[Kara Xavier]], a root system that runs through our planet that seems to contain a primal version of [[Magic]]. They exhibit unique properties, such as heightening effectivity of magic and mana, bestowing strange symptoms onto [[Spirits]] and [[Magical Beings]], and even effecting the natural order of the world around it.

Mana veins were first discovered by esteemed researcher Kara Xavier. When discovered they were found in a dormant state, and could only be sensed by those attuned to them. She spent a great deal of her life researching them, eventually mapping out their entire root system throughout the world. All Mana Veins are interconnected and seem to spread around the world like a net. After the [[History & Timeline|Solar Disaster]] occurred, the Mana Veins became active, running through the world in a continuous loop. Eventually many people used Kara's research as a basis for magic study and practice, helping in countless aspects of life.
