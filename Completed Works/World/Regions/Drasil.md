As a result of Gaia’s power, five of the planet's continents (Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Africa) were formed into one larger continent alongside many of the smaller Oceanic. This larger continent became known as Drasil, whilst the remaining unconnected parts of the earth such as old Australia or Antarctica remain unnamed. Due to the force used to conjoin Drasil, the entire continent now acts as a large island that does not connect to the bottom of the earth, it is instead perpetually held afloat by the remnants of Gaia’s magic that was expelled from her body after her passing.

## Regions
The Continent of Drasil is separated into many regions, each divided by their political views, stances and leaders. Each region has its own ruling body and aligns with one of the globally recognized [[Groups & Factions|reigning factions]].
