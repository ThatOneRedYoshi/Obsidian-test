Kariwa Encampment is a private training camp located on the outskirts of [[Kariwa City]]. It offers training for both military and magic alike and it used to train the soldiers of the [[Collective Capital]] and [[Experimental Zone]] armies. It's rules are the same as the city's and its entrance examinations are strict. The Campus is full of training courses for all types of military training and magic practice, courses and exercises are held from early hours of the day to late in the night with few breaks in between. There is no classrooms in the encampment and all classes are practical and handled much like standard military training drills. Students are expected to have perfect attendance and punctuality and are often expelled after five absences or even sometimes less. All students are treated equally regardless of background and there is no room for bias or favouritism from instructors.
