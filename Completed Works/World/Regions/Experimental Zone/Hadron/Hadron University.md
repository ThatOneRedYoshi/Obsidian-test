Hadron University is a privatised university dedicated to the study of science. Offering in-field study and access to rare [[Resources]], it is the number one choice for any aspiring student in the field of science. With rules that are even stricter than the city it is found within, Hadron University students are not considered citizens of [[Hadron City]], thus they are not allowed to exit campus alone and are not permitted to communicate with the city’s people. Hadron University Campus is quite large, consisting of the university building, two dormitory buildings and a small park area for communion. Outside of lecture halls, the university has several testing facilities and a library for students to study inside. Most students' field of study will have them leave campus and perform work in the wilderness of Hadron, these study trips can last several days or even weeks at a time. Much like the city, Hadron university has an early curfew, enacts a strict “No Parties” rule, and has their students study six days a week, with long days of ten hours of mandatory study. Students who graduate Hadron University are immediately offered jobs in both [[Hadron]] as well as [[Phoeba]] and [[Argo]].
