# City
Hadron City is a relatively small city with a population of roughly 100,000 people. It is constructed mostly of grey concrete buildings and metal warehouses. Much of the city is dedicated to study and many of the buildings are used as testing facilities and storage. The homes are usually one story homes that fit two or three people at most. Streets are quite compact in [[Hadron]] and there are only a select few SUV vehicles used for transport, while large cargo trucks are used to transport goods. Hadron City is also home to [[Hadron University]], which has its own campus area.

# History
Hadron City has always operated mostly independently of the other cities, their work focused on the study of magic and items that are infused with magic. Initially used as a country to study magic-imbued minerals, they have begun to focus their studies in more recent times toward  the study of [[Lusii & Belua|Lusii]] and how they operate their [[Magic]], presently very little success has been made in these studies. Hadron City is expanding in order to further this study, including opening the Hadron University and offering aspiring students the chance to work in-field study programs.
