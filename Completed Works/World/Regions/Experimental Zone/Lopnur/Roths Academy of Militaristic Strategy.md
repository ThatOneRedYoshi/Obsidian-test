Roths Academy of Military Strategy is a heavily prestigious academy founded by [[Medusa Roths]]. It is a private institute which requires special clearance to study at and teaches fields of military strategy, rules of warfare and ethics of war. Unlike [[Hadron University|Hadron’s University]], RAMS students are permitted access to the main city due to having special clearance from government officials, in fact RAMS students are taught to live in the same ways as the citizens of [[Lopnur]] in order to further discipline them for real war scenarios. The academy consists of a large mock version of a military base that is used to give real world demonstrations for things such as military protocol, vehicle and equipment training, physical fitness and exercise routines, first aid and so on.
