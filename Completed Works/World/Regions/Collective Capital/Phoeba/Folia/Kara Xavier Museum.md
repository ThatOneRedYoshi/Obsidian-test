The Kara Xavier Museum is a location in [[Folia]].

The Kara Xavier Museum is a tribute museum dedicated to the late genius, [[Kara Xavier]]. Kara’s work was submitted by an unknown sponsor during the city’s early days, this knowledge was used as a foundation for the city’s construction and offered insights into topics that are still shrouded in mystery to this day. Kara’s work was focused primarily on religious studies, many of her works providing information about the origins of magics, the prospect of divine beings, information on the spiritual and the link between life, knowledge and magic. Some of her lesser work that was used as a basis for the construction of Phoeba includes studies into a  phenomenon in the earth where the flow of spirits and magic is the strongest, this was used by magic wielding builders to help structural stability. The Museum itself describes Kara’s life, her work and her goal to create an object of pure perfection.
