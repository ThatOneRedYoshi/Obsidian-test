The Glaspalast is the enormous mirror palace located in the centre of [[Kathre]] city. The palace is grandiose, being built on the only cliff within the entire city and having a two hundred step climb just to reach the entrance. The palace itself is a four story behemoth, made mostly up of mirrors. Inside of the palace there is a dining room larger than a common home, equipped with a kitchen and food storage room, an immense ballroom, a library, upwards of twenty bedrooms including four staff rooms, a great hall and a throne room. On the exterior the palace has a front and rear courtyard. Despite its immense size, the Glaspalast has less than twenty active staff, ten working the day shift and ten during the night, of these staff twelve of them are maids/servants, while eight of them are guards. 

The Glaspalast was first build by [[Gaia Roths]] during her reign as queen, it has been the [[To Be Added Documents/Characters/Groups/Lead Factions/Roths Family]] home ever since.
