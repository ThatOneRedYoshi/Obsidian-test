## City
[[Argo|Argo's]] capital city of Kathre is a beautiful, prosperous city, located right in the centre of [[Argo]]. Its architecture has various cylindrical designs for its buildings and has very few square buildings. Buildings are also often coated with a layer of stained glass over the top, many buildings are also mostly constructed of glass, this is a design choice to reflect heat and to help prevent the growth of mould during humid days, this also means the city is very brightly lit even during the night time. The paths are often full of greenery, flowers, trees etc. The most notable tourist site of Kathre is the [[Glaspalast]], a humongous palace formerly with an exterior constructed of glass. After [[Athena|Athena's]] impromptu takeover of the family, however, the palace has been converted to being a massive mirror palace. The [[Glaspalast]] is where the ruler of the [[Roths Family]] and their closest relatives and associates reside.

## History
After the [[History & Timeline|war]], [[Argo]] city was divided into four cities, becoming known as the four connected cities. Each city served a functional purpose within the region, Kathre purpose was to house the upper class, namely notable families and politicians within [[Argo]]. Kathre itself lacks much of a history, as its history was built before [[Argo]] city was divided into the four connected cities, however, after the [[History & Timeline|war]], many flowers were planted along the roadsides and paths, most notably apple trees and chequered lilies, in commemoration of the war effort.
