## **History**
Argo as a division was formed at the same time as the other five divisions, however its history begins far before that. Its capital city, [[Kathre]] was founded alongside the four connected cities (commonly referred to as Argo City), at the nation's inception and was the first city ever built after the region's founding. It has remained to be the primary living place of the [[Roths Family|Roths]] for its entire existence.

Argo started out as a small city built on the cusp between the old and new worlds, ever since then it has been a progressive division that has continued to expand into a variety of bustling cities with strong economic power. Argo is where many founding families of the [[Collective Capital|Capital]] came to live and remained to this day, being the central division where the [[Roths Family|Roths]] reside, it’s only natural that it would overtime become the centralised military power of the region. Many people who moved there are historically soldiers and people willing to fight for their region, over the generations the division developed a smaller border specifically around itself as an extra layer of defence against any potential threats, though the area itself has historically never suffered any real threats due to its sheer power.

During the [[History & Timeline|war]], many of the citizens of the region were drafted to defend the region, this only boosted the regions militaristic nature. The strongest fighters were sent out to fight, while the weaker ones remained on the lines of defence, this strategy however, would prove to be a mistake as the defence groups were incapable of fending off oncoming monster attacks from migrating air [[Lusii & Belua|Lusii]]. Thankfully for them, due to the lack of civilians within the division and the support they received from the surrounding divisions, the damage dealt to the division was minimal, this oversight however, lead the division to invest further into defensive power after the war, the area itself now having a large protective barrier doming over its borders.

Nowadays the region remains a military powerhouse, the majority of people living there are aspiring magic users learning to fight for their region.

## **Climate, Geography and Wildlife**
Of the entire region, Argo is by far the flattest area, the land is full of greenery, roads between cities are flower gardens as far as the eye can see, it’s a division full of life.

The weather in Argo is typically always sunny but not hot, sunny days remain average temperature and rainy days are usually still quite warm, during rainstorms the area can become quite humid which lead the regions to make certain architectural decisions to prevent any unwanted side effects from this humidity.

The area does not suffer any natural disasters, this is due to the barriers protecting it and the earth being securely formed together by [[Gaia Roths|Gaia]] during its inception.

The area has very few Lusii thanks to its vast protective plans, this means the majority of people living there will go their entire life without even seeing a monster up close. It also lacks regular animals meaning the majority of people in the division live off of plant and protein substitutes, the majority of people have evolved to be able to survive off of these diets and so eating foreign foods often has undesirable health issues.

## **Living Conditions**
Argo as a division has great living conditions, you never have to worry about basic needs not being met and most people are able to dedicate themselves to their personal lives, however life for military and students in the division can be very exhausting, there is strict curfews and regulations in place to make sure those in charge of fighting for the region are at top form.

Argo is considered the highest point of life for most people, the most high class and wealthy typically live there.

## **Culture**
The culture within Argo is not very diverse, the majority of people fully devote their loyalty to the Roths and thus religion is practically non-existent in the division, as stated the division is very militaristic so the majority of people hold beliefs that align with that lifestyle, as such many people in the division are supportive of war efforts and support the idea of the entire world being under one rule. People of the division also believe in hard work, no matter your profession, the more you put into society the more you should get out of it, as such people of the division are typically very hard working and passionate about what they do, they see work as a hobby as opposed to a job and believe that you should work at the job that best suits you, slackers and people who don’t work hard are often ridiculed and shamed by their peers.

## **Government**
Argo is run directly by the Roths family. Its present leader, Medusa Roths, is a relatively neutral leader, working to maintain order and peace in the Capital. Medusa is a leader focused on security, her policies consist of strict militarization and policing, with guards and patrols set all around the city. Medusa also enforces a heavy border guard to ensure low crime rates and to prevent spies and infiltrators .
