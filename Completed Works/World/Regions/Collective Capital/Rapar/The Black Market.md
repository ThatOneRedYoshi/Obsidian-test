Hidden away in the darkest corners of [[The Tube]] hides the most corrupt and illegal businessmen in all of [[Drasil]]. Operations move through the black market regularly and are never in one place. A secret code is used amongst regulars and merchants within the black market, to communicate the upcoming locations and operations of the merchants. The locations of these dark corners are shrouded in mystery, and the merchants always seem to be one step ahead of the authorities. There are rumours of a sort of legion, operating within the black market.
