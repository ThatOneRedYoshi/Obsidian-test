## **Military History**
The Capital’s military is a united military formed early into the regions life cycle, originally built as a single all purpose army it was later branched out to have more strategic placement and command, each branch has its own unique training, combat style and equipment, historically the army has always been controlled by the Roths however the control has now been handed to Verde Nightingale who oversees all military operation. The Capital’s military primarily consists of only people as the majority of their military power is held in the Experimental Zone.

## **Military Branches**

### Royal Guard
The earliest formed branch of the Capital’s military, the Royal Guards are tasked with policing, guarding and protecting the region's most important internal areas, the Royal Guards have historically always been the strongest of the Capital’s military as they protect vital infrastructure that if destroyed could cause the entire region to collapse. Training for the Royal Guards is rigorous and many often fail the training as they have to be the absolute best of the best to pass, joining the Royal Guard means you often have no free time because it will all be dedicated to training and learning, the training process includes weapons training, magic training, physical training and morality training, the latter of which is designed to ensure soldiers make the right choices when in a tough situation.

Every member of the Royal Guard is equipped with a rapier, this is meant as a dedicated quick drawn weapon designed primarily for intimidation, often used for arrests and non lethal combat by attacking non vital organs to apprehend a target, they are also equipped with a non-lethal taser, this taser is a simple standard taser used for arrests. No other equipment is used as Royal Guards are expected to use magic for any encounters requiring non-lethal force. 

Typical days for Royal Guards consist of patrolling designated routes around pivotal areas of the Capital, apprehending unlawful people and maintaining peace, during wartime Royal Guards hold a very similar roles however they are often set up to use more lethal force on any potential threats, Royal Guard squads usually consist of 4-8 people per squad and typically are not allowed to be out of sight of at least one other squad member.

### Border Control
Originally members of the Royal Guard, the Border Control unit was formed after realising the general strategies of the Royal Guard were not sufficient to prevent illegal border crossing and breaching, the border control has a variety of personnel dedicated for a variety of situations. Border Control members are typically those who failed to make the Royal Guard but were still highly regarded for their abilities.

#### Control Officer
Control Officers are equipped with a JUNC-Tech designed facial scanner, a standard issue Defragmenter and a JUNC-Tech Littleboy Bodysuit. The Scanner is utilised to access the registered citizens database and uses high intelligence scanning to recognize a person, this speeds up the process of entering especially for those without documents, the Defragmenter is used purely to apprehend and remove anyone trying to cross illegally or otherwise causing a commotion without issue and finally the Littleboy Bodysuit is used to protect incoming attacks

Control Officers are placed at checkpoints around the border and are in charge of ensuring legal and safe entry for all people crossing over, should a dangerous situation arise Control Officers are to use their issued Defragmenter to apprehend the subject of the attack.

#### Border Watch
 Border Watch units are located around the perimeter of the border and are tasked with guarding the perimeter from threats, including but not limited to, Lusii attacks, illegal entry attempts or attempted attacks. Border Watch are equipped with Fat-Man Bodysuits, Starburst Shotgun and Sweeping Rifles, The Bodysuits are designed to deal with high impact assaults while the Starburst is used primarily to fend off monsters with its high heat rounds, the Sweeping Rifle is used to target and incapacitate far away targets and large groups.

Border Watch administer different strategies depending on the situation, against Lusii they administer a deter or eliminate strategy, their first attempt will be to intimidate the Lusii with loud noises and warning shots, should that fail they will move onto phase two which will be extermination, this typically involves close range combat with the Starburst.

Against people, the Border Watch officers will first attempt to communicate that they are out of bounds and should turn around, if they do not move or seem to pose a threat then the officers will move onto incapacitation followed by an arrest, during a high level threat or assault Border Watch will use their own magic abilities to administer lethal damage to their target.

#### Air Watch
Air Watch units are very similar to the Border Watch units, their mission is to defend against incoming aerial breaches from the border, this includes humans and Lusii. Air Watch units are equipped with Fat-Man Bodysuits, Sweeping Rifles, Tsar Cannons and JUNC-Tech Com-Receivers the former two are utilised the same way as the Border Watch whereas the Tsar Cannons are used to shoot down strong aircraft and Lusii that may attempt to cross the border, Com-Receivers are used to attempt communication to aircraft.

Strategies for the unit are also very similar to the Border Watch, first they will attempt intimidation of Lusii and if that doesn’t work then lethal force will be administered, against people units will use the Com-Receivers to attempt radio communication with the other party, at the sign of hostility or if there was failure to communicate they will first fire warning shots to deter the target, if the target persists they will be shot down using the Tsar Cannon.


### Scouts
Founded in Ather, the Scouts branch is an intelligence agency whose sole purpose is to gather military and political intel with their vast net of scouting resources. Scout training typically starts from a young age, Scouts, ironically are often scouted by the army and tend to be gifted children.

The Scouts fall into two categories, The Watchers and The Recon, The Watchers operate inside of Ather’s Church of the All Seeing. Utilising the All Seeing Eye, they observe the world through their highly trained Ascalaphus’ this unit is typically dedicated to scoping out regions and spying. The Recon unit are in-field operatives, the only equipment they hold is a JUNC-Tech Com-Receiver and a Dwarf Shotgun as if they are ever compromised they’re already as good as dead, the Dwarf Shotgun is solely for fending off Lusii.

Recon unit members' primary strategy is infiltration and insider work, their main goals are to blend in with other groups and gather intelligence from them, they also access private devices and information from inside opposing territories.

### Stormers
Stormers were founded during the war, they’re the typical foot soldier of the military and are in charge of frontal assaults and offence. Training for the Stormers is tough, but a lot more forgiving than the royal guard. Stormers are seen as more expendable than guards so their training, although similar to the Royal Guards, is vastly easier.

Stormers are equipped with Clot Rifles, Defragmenters, Com-Receivers and Megaton Bodysuits, Outside of the Com-Receiver all of the equipment is designed for heavy front-loaded assaults, the Com-Receiver being used for strategic communication.

Stormers primarily move in groups of thirty, their approach is strategic but head on, focusing on clearing areas first and asking questions later, squads usually consist of one captain, one co-captain, three medics and twenty-five soldiers, unlike the other members of the unit medics will also carry standard first-aid kits. Stormers operate on a kill on-sight order which is standard, unless otherwise instructed. They're only typically deployed to deal with potential threats, so are often dropped into hostile territory.
