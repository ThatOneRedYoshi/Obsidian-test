## **City**
[[Ather|Ather's]] capital of Phulax derives its name from a historical god who once protected the land thousands of years ago, Phulax is a bright white city made up from the crystal-like material, [[Vlepounite]]. Created many generations ago, Vlepounite is a bright white crystal that shines and has a solid interior, however, due to its weight, many buildings are built with external support beams, made from solid concrete to better support the structure. The buildings oftentimes take grandiose shapes and every building in the city has an important feel to it, even smaller houses are often shaped like small cathedrals emphasising their importance. Architecture in the city is very reminiscent of the style of classical Greek architecture, made out of the aforementioned bright crystal-like material.

Phulax’s main areas are full of buildings for [[Faiths|religious]] and spiritual practice. Places of prayer and worship can be found all over, these buildings are often noticeable through their more rounded shape and are often pure white, typically having their divine figure or other symbolic imagery carved into the walls. The more civil areas of the city contain more squared buildings, these buildings are still white, however, they often have painted wooden components, such as window frames, doors etc. These buildings are notably less important in appearance, this also applies for general retail and commercial areas.

Phulax’ main landmark is the Church of the All Seeing, a central information network where intel is gathered, maintained and transferred, it also acts as a museum of sorts where many ancient religious and magic artefacts, including Vlepoun’s all seeing eye, are maintained and put on display for all to see, unlike the other divisions the current leader of the region does not reside here and instead they reside in a whole different town just outside of Phulax.

## **History**
True to its loyalist history, Phulax was built in Delora, a state right on the border of Argo. Phulax’s history runs largely parallel to the rest of the region of Ather, it was only in more recent times that Phulax began to develop an identity for itself. Within the last fifty years, holy places of worship and religion have begun to appear all across the city, an attempt to create peace and quell the unresting divide amongst the citizens, places of worship were placed practically adjacent to one another in order to force communities to interact with one another, this has caused much in-fighting within the city. Phulax is also a leading force in global relations, namely with more religious and spiritual regions such as the harmonic sector.
