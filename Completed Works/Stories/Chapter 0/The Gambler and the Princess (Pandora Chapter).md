“What do I remember from that day? It’s hard to say~. Before I awoke, the world was gleaming with light… Yes… I remember, everything was spinning and-” There is a brief and awkward silence. “Anyways, this conversation is borrrring~.” Jests the blonde haired woman as she fixes her eyes back to her interrogator. “So… What’s your name anyways?” she asks as she playfully places her face in her hands. Glaring back at her, the sparkling, silver haired woman pauses momentarily before replying. “Forgive me for not stating my identity earlier, Miss Pandora. I am Princess Athena Roths, acting head of the Roths royal lineage and heir to the throne. Though given our similarities in status, you may refer to me simply as Athena.” Pandora sighs “Your formality… it’s sickening.” She scoffs mockingly. “Anyways, let’s not beat around the bush. Who are you really?” Pandora asks in a more sinister tone of voice. Athena seems dumbfounded, showing visual confusion on her face. Pandora shrugs her answer off, “Well if you don’t wanna talk about it-”. There is another long, awkward pause before Athena shakes off the previous comment and composes herself. “Pandora, I humbly request that you stay with the Roths family for the time being until we are able to discern your identity” Pandora does not hesitate to agree, much to Athena’s surprise. Content, having accomplished what she wished to, Athena turns towards the exit, ready to return to her palace when Pandora calls to her and beckons her over. Pandora holds out her hand to Athena, who in turn holds her hand out to. In her hand, Pandora places an unusual card, depicting an angel calling people up towards the sky. Athena looks at the card blankly. "Don't let the dealer decide your hand, my dear Athena~." Pandora remarks with a grin. Athena leaves, Pandora following her like a lost puppy. 

After returning to the palace, Athena wastes no time showing Pandora her room, a large royal bedroom bathed with silver, gold and red colours, the epitome of royalty, both women seamlessly blending amongst the furniture like perfect puzzle pieces. Athena removes her hands from her front and raises them, levelling them with her chest. With two sharp claps she calls upon a maid and servant, their black clothes opposing the gleam of the room. Politely and quietly, Athena turns to withdraw from the room, before being stopped by the sound of Pandora clearing her throat in a manner to entice her attention. “Surely you don’t plan to leave me bored and alone? Right Princess?~”. Tilting her head forward in disapproval, Athena tuts back at the aberrant young woman. “I am quite certain, Miss Pandora, that you will find a means to entertain yourself.” She asserts in a strict yet emotionless tone. Loud, echoing footsteps ring through the hall as Athena leaves. Both the maid and servant bow courteously, silently offering their assistance to the new lady of the house. Disinterested however, Pandora dismisses them with a wave, instead opting to find ways to entertain herself. Time seemed to come to a stop as minutes began to feel like hours, the beautifully decorated room was full of nothing that might entertain her. 

Idleness only caused time to drag on further, before she knew it she had begun wandering the palace, browsing the various extravagant rooms contained within. Placing her ear up to one of the countless bedrooms in the palace, Pandora heard not a hint of sound, skipping onwards to the next bedroom, she was met with the same tune. Many times she repeats this ritual, every time having it come up the same, she continues to skip down the halls, her footsteps echoing through the vastness of these lonely halls. As if by a comedic stroke of luck, Pandora finds herself in the dining hall, right on cue for dinner. Contrary to the image conjured in Pandora’s head, the dining table was not covered in food from one end to the other, instead a humble four meals were prepared, one placed at the farthest seat to the right, placed before Athena, the next is placed adjacent to her, obviously in place for Pandora, the third was placed three seats down from Athena, with an unusual looking man seated at it, finally one last meal is placed at the head of the table, not a soul seated before it. Athena calls Pandora over to take a seat, as she does so, one of the servants bows before Athena. “Will her majesty be joining us today, your highness?” Both Athena and the man seated across the table halt all action, lowering their heads to look at the table, Athena biting her lower lip for a brief moment before raising her head back up. “Her grace would like to recover a little more.” Athena takes a deep breath, holding it in for a moment, before letting out a deep exhale and continuing. “I shall take her meal up to her shortly.” Placing the silver cloche back over the platter, the servant leaves the trio in peace, an awkward silence suddenly permeating the room and they all eat in silence.
Not a single word is spared between them until their meal is finished, servants returning to the dining hall to collect up the mess. 

Athena takes the remaining meal and begins to walk away, the unusual man having also left the room. Pandora, filled with curiosity, uses her magic to conceal herself and begins following the princess as she heads towards the bedrooms. Athena however, does not stop at the Queen’s bedchamber, she continues onwards, performing a perfect loop around the palace before exiting through the back entrance. Stepping outside, Pandora watches from the side as Athena feeds the food to a group of Ascalphus, owl-like creatures that seem to reside in the trees behind the palace. Athena appears to smile and converse with the creatures, though Pandora was too far out to make out the conversation. Quickly losing interest in such a boring conclusion, Pandora retreats to her room to rest. 

As the sun rises on a brand new day, the cycle of boredom repeats, Pandora attempts to amuse herself by irritating the palace staff, however, Pandora’s royal status meant that they were unable to react or reciprocate her behaviour. Disappointed, Pandora leaves the staff alone and instead wanders the palace to try and find Athena. “Dear Athena!~” she calls through the halls, her voice reverberating through the glass-walled halls. Pandora peeks her head into nearly every single room in the palace until finally finding Athena. “Athena!~ Whatcha doin’?” Pandora asks with whimsy in her voice. Athena does not turn to look at her, instead she keeps her attention to her work. Pandora glances over her shoulder to see what she is working on, a draft copy of the public declaration of Pandora’s status as an adopted member of the Roths. Pandora giggled to herself, sitting on the table that Athena was writing on. “I take it, I should get ready?” Pandora inquires sarcastically. Athena almost lets out a small smile before catching herself, returning to her neutral expression. “No need, I will handle this.” Pandora glares suspiciously at Athena for a moment before pushing herself off of the table. "Kayyy~" she says playfully as she walks towards the door. Letting out a light chuckle as Pandora leaves, Athena continues her work, listening to the playful woman's gleeful footsteps echo through the hall in a perfect rhythm. 

A few more days pass by, Pandora being completely clueless about the declaration and not much caring either. Jaded from a lack of entertainment, Pandora lays in her bed, rolling side to side in her sheets, pulling the bedding around her body. Finally, as if answering her prayers, a light knock sounds from her door. As Pandora opens the door, she sees Athena, standing in the doorway with her hands placed formally to her front. "Good morning, dear sister. Are you free today?" she asks with a polite smile. Pandora looks at her confused, but nods her head in accordance. Pandora takes a short while to get ready before the two head out into town, they venture together through the high streets of the capital, browsing various stores as they go. Kathre, the capital city where the palace was located, has a bustling high street, countless stores selling priceless goods for the wealthy, unaffordable to the common folk. The duo spent a great deal of time chatting and shopping together; time seemed to fly by. One of the last stores they visited was a jewellery store that specialised in gold accessories. Athena offered to purchase whatever accessories Pandora took a fancy to. Turning her face away for a moment, Pandora grinned mischievously to herself. She began browsing the stands of the store, picking out a vast amount of extravagant golden neckwear and arm wear, she knew there was no way that Athena would accept to buy so much. Pandora returns to Athena with her assortment of accessories and hands them over to Athena. "Is this all?" she asks with a completely neutral face. Pandora stares at her, completely baffled by her response. As Athena pays for the items and hands them back to Pandora, she can't help but feel like Athena was the one pulling an elaborate prank on her this whole time. 

Both head home as the night begins to fall over them. Upon returning to the palace, the pair go their separate way, both to their bedrooms. Chuckling to herself as she is walking back, Pandora ponders the events of today to herself, how absurd that a royal of such refinement would invite her out for such a childish day out. Her walk slows as she looks behind herself, gazing down the dark, empty halls. Returning her gaze to her front, she grasps one of the necklaces in the palm of her hand, inspecting it closely. Merely looking at the necklace causes her to recount the events of today, her whole body feeling uncomfortably warm as she does. Almost immediately, she shakes off these thoughts and feelings and continues ambling to her room. Those soft, messy bedsheets felt unusually pleasant tonight, perhaps the mental fatigue has finally caught up to her, or perhaps it was something else. Pandora does not complain however, as perhaps a good night's rest was all she needed to revitalize herself. Unfortunately for Pandora, it seems she had one more matter to attend to before resting. 

The silhouette of a young, messy haired girl stood looming just outside of her window. Pandora's face gleams with intrigue, she analyses the shadowy figure for around a minute before opening the window. Hot air rushed into her room, but the figure was nowhere to be seen, vanishing the moment the window opened. Suddenly, from behind Pandora, a caustic laugh erupts, though she can tell it was coming from behind her, the laugh rang out as if it were piercing the inside of her ear. Turning in an instant to face the perpetrator, the void figure lounges on Pandora's dresser, still bathed in total darkness even amidst the illumination of the grandiose chandelier. Unphased as she may have been, Pandora still holds up her guard, likely out of instinct. The shadow begins to move as if in a way to imitate speaking, though it had no visible mouth or features. "Alright, alright, don't get ya' hair in a twist, kay? I ain't gonna hurt ya'." Footsteps can suddenly be heard rushing down the hall, the door to Pandora's room suddenly slamming open. "Madam Pandora, are you alright?" a lowly maid frantically asks. The shade groans, infuriated by the distraction. "Tsk- you on the other hand..." In a heartbeat, the door slams closed once more, the room becoming ever infested with only the sound of the  rushing wind through the wide open window. Despite her fearlessness, Pandora could not move a muscle, her limbs felt like they were being bound by an unseen force and her neck ached as if she were being strangled. The figure snapped her fingers, the click echoing loud enough to momentarily cancel out the sound of the wind. For a moment nothing happened, then suddenly the maid's shadow began to shift, contort and change, initially looking just like she were shaking, but then it began to expand. It were as if countless fingers were trying to reach out from the inside of her shadow, she screamed in pain but couldn't move a muscle, her shadow oozing a liquid before exploding in time with her agonised screams. 

The maid's physical body then became engulfed in shadows, until she sunk into the floor, now appearing as a disembodied shadow resting on the floor. The lingering figure then lifts the shadow from the ground like a puppet, raising the maid's shadow so that she stands alongside her. Pandora, however, remains completely unamused, not even batting an eye at the scene in front of her. The figure begins to laugh hysterically in spite of this. "You really are as cold as she told me!" Her laughter continues for a while longer before she composes herself. Pandora suddenly plunges to the ground, as if the force binding her simply let go of its grip, however, she very quickly adjusts from this, brushing it off as if it were nothing.  Stood with her curious eyes fixed on the shadow, she waits patiently for it to speak. A moment passes, then, after clearing her throat, the shadow holds out her hand, holding within it a blank card, much like the one Pandora had previously handed to Athena. "Moon's shining bright tonight, eh?" the figure says, her voice now spoken in a softer and more composed manner. "Boss lady told me not to reveal too much, so I gotta make this brief, ‘kay? Wouldn't want that vile princess catching me here." Pandora yawns sarcastically, looking away from the figure. "HEY! Cut a girl some slack, would ya? This wasn't even meant to be my job!" She screeches before returning to a soft muttering. "But that halfwit muscle-head was too busy to come." Her demeanour changes as she takes a stance of frustration, folding her arms and turning her head. "I tell ya, that idiot is always the boss lady's favourite." The figure continues muttering to herself for a while before regathering her thoughts. "Right! Anyways, back to the point. Boss lady's interested in ya, ya get me? If you ever wanna rewrite ya destiny..." She stops, hearing faint footsteps down the halls. "Crud... Guess I gotta shoot. That card'll give ya all the answers, ya hear?" She instantly begins fading into the shadows, both she and the maid she had engulfed before, disappear without a trace, perfectly in time to avoid Athena, who knocks on the door gently. 

"Pandora? Are you awake?" Athena asks in a soft yet clear tone. Pandora, having already disregarded the previous encounter, opens the door for Athena. "My apologies, did I catch you at a poor time? I heard some unusual noises echoing through the halls, I thought Ida might have coerced you into watching one of those scary movies." She states with a polite bow before returning her gaze to the woman in front of her. Pandora scratches her head. "Ida?" She questions. "Oh! Have you not met her? Ida is our late night maid, she is simply a pleasure to be around!" Athena states with a smile. "Ah, I don't think I have met her yet"  Pandora responds dismissively, keeping her expression as neutral as possible. "I see. Regardless, I simply came to ensure that you were faring well. Now that I have checked up on you, I shall bid you a goodnight once more" Athena says before retreating back through the halls. Pandora lets out a relieved sigh, grateful that she is finally able to get a well deserved rest. 

The sun rises brightly on another day. Despite the detour from her sleep, Pandora was able to sleep quite soundly. Sticking to her usual routine, she prepares to seek out Athena once again. Having grown used to her habits by now, Pandora found Athena quite efficiently, tracking her to the palace's study.  "Dear Athena!~ Wanna do something today?" Pandora asks while prodding at Athena's facing. Athena does not hesitate to react. "My apologies, I am rather busy today. Perhaps we can make plans another day?" Pandora pouts like a child, grumbling to herself and pacing for a moment, before agreeing and walking away. With her plans for the day trampled, she decides to wander around the palace grounds, roaming every hall, taking in the garden scenery and finally visiting the Ascalphus. After concluding all of that, Pandora has just about spent a whole day. Having exhausted all her energy, Pandora decides to skip dinner and head to bed. Rising early to start the process again, Pandora takes another chance at Athena, receiving the same answer as yesterday. Today, however, she decides to stay with Athena, hoping to at least spark conversation while she works, however, silence lingers in the room, the two remaining awkward and not a word being exchanged as the sound of the clock ticking away feels louder and louder. Seconds become minutes, minutes become hours, every attempt to strike up conversation was struck down by single sentence answers. Once more, Pandora concluded the day, having only bored herself further. 

Rising on another day, Pandora repeats this cycle, and it continues, day after day, until one day Pandora's patience grows thin. With a devious smile, Pandora enters Athena's office, she begins doing everything she can to irritate or annoy Athena, prodding her, pulling her chair, making loud noises, but nothing manages to bother her, it was as if they weren't even there. Growing jaded from her pointless attempts, Pandora decides to take a walk through the city. Skipping right through the high stress, Pandora sets her eyes on areas that are much more secluded, the type of place where the less fortunate are likely to congregate. Before long, Pandora was able to find an underground casino, in fact it was so easy to find for her that she wondered how it had evaded the authorities for so long. Initially, Pandora thought it might be a fun idea to instigate a raid on the place, but after observing for a while and getting a decent grasp of how the card games work, Pandora had a much more amusing idea. Pandora used her magic to alter her appearance, masquerading as one of the common folk who may come here. 

Naturally, Pandora had no money, so she would have to use illusions furthermore to deceive the staff into thinking she was a paying player. It came as little surprise to the incongruous, blonde lady that the people here were easily deceived, and she was able to participate with ease. Game after game she won, every so often she would alter her disguise and win rate in order to avoid suspicion from the staff. This act made attaining a large amount of wealth unfathomably easy for her, but she wasn't interested in the money, she had a much different motive. Concluding yet another game, she watched in pleasure as one of her opponents began to seethe at his losses, he quickly began pointing fingers at the staff, accusing the games of being rigged, this uprising causing others to speak up too. As anger filled the room, Pandora found an opportunity to sneak away, obscuring herself on the upper level and watching down as the rioting continued. Anger turns to shouting, and shouting turns to violence, Pandora watches with a grin as the people begin to turn on each other, before anyone knew it the casino was in a full on free-for-all, punches being thrown and objects flying around like a warzone. Pleased with herself, Pandora left the scene of the crime, smugly listening to the chaos left behind as she leaves. 

Returning to the palace with a great deal of satisfaction, her smile quickly fades as she sees a very unhappy looking Athena awaiting her alongside a sizable group of guards. “Pandora! Would you care to explain why I have spent the entire day leading a search party for you?” Pandora simply rolls her eyes, attempting to walk past Athena, however, she is swiftly blocked by the guards who block her path forward. A long and uninteresting lecture ensues from Athena, though Pandora was not paying attention to a word of it, she is eventually able to feign an apology and promise not to do it again, before returning to her room. Many more days pass, Pandora remains to be as bored as ever, watching the seconds tick by in her room. She lays in her bed, having exhausted every possible interesting idea she could have tried, she hadn’t the slightest interest in reading, training, or any of the other tedious activities being a Roths could offer her. Eventually she stands up from her bed and practically drags herself to her dresser, sitting in front of it on her stool. Sulking was not an expression that suited her, she thought about that as she glared at herself in the mirror, her usual self had been tainted by a perpetual boredom, she felt that she couldn’t bear it anymore. Walking over to her window, she glances up longingly at the crescent moon in the sky, something suddenly clicks in her mind, she strolls back over to her dresser and takes the blank card from out of her draws, turning back to her window as she does. 

Her mind was made, if nothing could entertain her here, then something bigger in the world surely could. Having nothing to her name meant that Pandora had no need to pack, but, before leaving, she did feel a compulsion to put all of her golden accessories on. With no desire to be found, Pandora would take the form of the maid Athena referred to as Ida. Imitating her mannerisms, the disguised Pandora would stroll politely through the halls, occasionally admiring herself in the countless mirrors placed throughout. It appeared as though none of the late night staff were around, making Pandora’s escape all the simpler. Success inflating her ego further, Pandora strolled right out of the palace entrance, exiting through the front gate with ease, she took a breath of the night's dense air, licking her lips as though she had just finished a grand meal. Pridefully, Pandora gazes back, staring up at the moon, feeling as if it were even closer now than it were from her bedroom. Greeting her though would not be the moon, instead, eclipsing it, would be the one obstacle to Pandora’s escape, a familiar figure she recounts seeing from the dining hall. Initially, they simply gaze down at Pandora from the palace’s rooftop, remaining as still as a statue as they observe her. In response to this staring contest invitation, Pandora arrogantly places her hands on her hips, smiling back up to them. This stand-off persists for around a minute, neither party making a move, Pandora could quite easily escape by simply creating an illusion, but that thought seemed unappealing to her, instead she was curious for how long this stand-off would last. 

Unfortunately, her opposition's patience was not equal to hers and they fired a warning shot behind her, a sharp, blood-red crystal in the shape of a spike, pierced the earth behind her before dissolving into blood. Pandora stood her ground, smiling even more as her opponent dived from the roof, their legs bulking up into a disgusting mass of flesh as they crashed into the ground, producing a large crater in the ground. Without a word, they draw their weapon, a small glass blade, half full of blood on the inside, they continue to walk towards Pandora, the flowers of the garden beginning to wilt as they pass them by. Pandora does not move an inch however, standing her ground perfectly still as she watches her attacker approach. By the time they stopped, the pair were little more than a meter apart, both once again standing in a perfect stand-off. After a brief moment of hesitation, the aggressor plunges their blade towards Pandora’s face, stopping it right before cutting her face, as if to test her reaction. Pandora continued to remain eerily still, their aggressor watching her every move. Pandora’s smile contorts into an uncanny grin, stretching across her face in a most unnatural manner. A sudden aching befalls the attacker as their arms begin to feel more heavy, they cautiously try to back away but as they do their arms seem to detach from their arms, yet they feel no pain, their arms still moving as if they were attached despite being disconnected from their body. Pain fills their gut as they are sent flying across the garden, crashing into the palace wall as they wince in pain. Upon reopening their eyes their arms are returned to where they should be and Pandora is nowhere to be seen. They attempt to stand, but the more they push themself up the heavier their body seems to become, making standing impossible. Struggling against themself, they manage to lift their face enough to see in front of them, the formerly vanished Pandora now quickly approaching from the front. 

Pandora picked up the glass blade from the ground, approaching slowly as her target continued to struggle in vain. Their struggle suddenly ceases as Pandora drops the blade next to them, they scurry for it, clutching onto it as the blood within had almost depleted. Unamused, Pandora decides to walk away from her opponent, no longer interested in his lack of ability to entertain her, however, as she walks through the wilted flowerbeds, the sky around her appears to crack like glass, before spreading into the ground too, the cracks completely surrounding her as she turns around, coming face to face with Athena. The two women exchange frustrated glances with one another, Pandora’s one of disappointment while Athena’s one of anger. “You’re not one for learning your lesson, are you?” Athena grunts, an unmatchable fury burning through her silver, glass eyes. In spite of her situation, Pandora could not help but giggle for a moment, even as the area around her was cracking into pieces, even in the face of death. Suddenly, everything fell silent, the cracks continued, creeping closer to Pandora as the air around her began to thin, still, Pandora did not show fear, she merely glared into Athena’s eyes, and Athena stared back at hers. Their gazes persisted for a moment that lingered on too long, giving both enough time to come to a mutual understanding. 

Athena looks down to Pandora’s body, a flare of gold reflecting through her silver eyes as she lets out an exasperated sigh, she releases Pandora from her confines and lowers her weapon. “If you truly wish to leave, I will not attempt to stop you. This place isn’t home to you, but that doesn’t mean you are not welcome here.” Regret and sorrow could be heard in Athena’s voice as she said those words to Pandora. For once however, Pandora was unable to laugh, she felt a little warm upon hearing Athena’s words, and though she was unable to return her warmth, Pandora still gave a sincere smile to Athena in return. As the two parted ways, Athena stopped in the middle of the wilted flowerbeds, gently picking up the individual who attacked Pandora before. “Before you go…” Athena pauses for a moment, taking a deep breath as her voice trembles slightly. “What happened to Ida?” Pandora raises her head and begins to smile slightly. “Who’s Ida?” she asks in an unemotive, monotone voice. Athena clenches her fist, gritting her teeth as she lowers her head. With no more words to say, the two false sisters separate even further apart, Pandora descending down the palace entrance staircase whilst Athena ascends up the stairs to the palace front door, their footsteps becoming ever more distant, until neither one can hear the others anymore.
