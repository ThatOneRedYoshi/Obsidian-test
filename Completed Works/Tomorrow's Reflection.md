## About Tomorrow's Reflection
Tomorrow's Reflection is an Urban Fantasy/Science-Fiction is a multi-media project consisting of interconnected works all set in/based around the same universe. Works in this project include, stories, poems, music, artwork and articles, and are all set in the interconnected continent of [[Drasil]], a land based centuries into the future in the where the societal hierarchy is based on the capabilities of one's [[Magic|magic]]. The world is ran by the [[Roths Family]], a royal family with a dark history and who are the cause of much political divide in [[Drasil]].

Tomorrow's Reflection is a project started in 2023 by myself and my friend Kaam. Kaam and I were discussing the unserious idea of putting all of our mutual friend group into a fighting game, beginning by conceptualising half baked ideas for move sets and designs. The project quickly devolved from that concept and became "Project Mirror", a code name for what would eventually become Tomorrow's Reflection. Characters and concepts quickly became their own thing, with their own unique personalities and traits that now remain only loosely connected to the people that originally inspired them, characters in future works would also originate from loosely inspired concepts from other people too. Then I began to build the world around them, at first the ideas were a little messy, I had to work them together into a world that made sense for them and make alterations to better accommodate my vision. 

What you are currently looking at is essentially a wiki page for all of the ideas I have made public either through expressing them to others or through documents. This acts as a complete archive of all available information, documents etc. 

**Disclaimer**: Tomorrow’s Reflection may use names of historical, political, influential or otherwise real people. These names should always be taken as purely coincidental and hold no bearing on my political or personal views. Tomorrow’s Reflection is a work of fiction and the meaning and value of names in the world holds very different meanings. While some names may be the same as their real life counterparts on purpose, this does not mean that connections should be drawn to the actual person(s) in question. Please research the meanings and histories of names before reaching any form of conclusion. Tomorrow’s Reflection contains elements of political discussion, however, I will be attempting to remain neutral on such topics, as I want readers to come to their own conclusions. Morality and ethics are a vast and complicated world and it is impossible for any one person to be proven completely right in their worldviews, please keep an open mind of that fact whilst you are reading.

**Do I have to read every piece of work to understand what is going on?**: No. Tomorrow’s Reflection is designed to be an expansive world, with many small stories running adjacent to its larger narrative. You are absolutely free to only read the main narrative without looking at any other documents, as the main story will explain all essential aspects of itself to the reader.

**Can I submit entries to the Wiki?**:By request of Emilia , I will gladly put works by other people that are not a part of the official project on display in their own entries. This can include art, theories, collected information etc, simply send me whatever you wish to add and I will gladly create a none-official works page. So you theorizers can now have your theories archived with sources and laid out information to boot. Want to keep your theory private? Perhaps due to incompleteness or simply not yet wanting me to see? Don't worry! All none-official entries are handled by Emilia and not myself, so I will not be personally seeing any of the work that I am not intended to. 

**About Notes**: Another suggestion given to me. Notes are sections located at the bottom of entries that can be submitted by readers to draw attention to particular details that others may have missed
