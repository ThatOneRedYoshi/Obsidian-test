**Contribution to Tomorrow's Reflection.**
Starting from Wiki Version 1.2, I will now be accepting suggestions and contributions to the wiki, these entries can be as follows. [[Lusii & Belua]], [[Resources]] (Such as minerals and plants), Lesser locations like towns or city locations, or [[Technology]] (Such as weapons or other tech). 
Contributions can be sent to me via message and will either be approved or not approved based on how well they fit into the world, if I like the idea I may make some minor alterations to better fit it, all work will be credited at the top of the page.

In addition, the unofficial wiki, which is being managed by Valentilia, is now available from the front page of the wiki, non-official works like art, stories, characters, theories and so on will be archived here.

Guidelines for contributions: Please follow the information seen in other entries of a similar type and try to include as much of the same type of information as possible, you are free to be a specific or vague as you wish so long as the information remains coherent and understandable, and fits into the world.
