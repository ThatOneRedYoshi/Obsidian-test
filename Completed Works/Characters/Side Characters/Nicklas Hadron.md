# History
During the founding of the [[Experimental Zone]], Nicklas was a politician from a political family. Not much is known about his politics before the founding of the Experimental Zone, but his views did not fully align with Gaia's, which is why he was appointed. His hopes for his region were to turn it into a fully fledged independent country, while maintaining his alliance with the [[Collective Capital]]. He focused his efforts on gaining power in both resources and commerce to help grow his nation. Eventually when the Experimental Zone split into three divisions, he used his wealth and influence to maintain power over two of the regions, [[Hadron]] and [[Kariwa]]. He would die soon after, passing his legacy onto his family.
