"Red" is a nickname for a reoccurring character appearing in countless places throughout [[Tomorrow's Reflection]].

# Profile
Red's first appearance was as a fortune teller in [[Chronos Character Backstory]]. She later appears in other points throughout history, such as [[Phoenix Character Backstory]] and [[Fight Club (Juno Chapter)]]. 
She is enigmatic and mysterious, showing up and vanishing just as quickly, always spouting cryptic words. She is distinguished by her fancy red dress.

# History
Her origins are a complete mystery and her appearances always seem random. Her first known appearance was in old China, likely around the time of the Qin or Han Dynasty, where she cryptically told [[Phoenix]] that she would provide him all of the answers he sought if he were to help eradicate the demons plaguing the dynasty. Upon doing as she instructed, "Red" gave Phoenix the location of [[The Balance|"The Balance"]], however she prevented him from reaching them before they were sealed away by [[Chronos]] and [[Mayan]].
The next appearance of "Red" would occur not long after this, a little after the battle between "The Balance" and Mayan/Chronos, "Red" would use the fear that humanity had now developed of higher powers as a means to conceal Mayan in a [[Pandora's Box| magic box]], placing the blame on humanity and deceiving Chronos in the process. 
"Red" would then appear centuries later before Chronos, posing as a fortune teller by the name of "Lavaux", she foretold that Chronos' future would bring her great loss and pain.
The final notable appearance of "Red" is during [[Fight Club (Juno Chapter)]], where she shows up during his encounter with a [[Ratatoskr (Plaga Rodentis)|Ratatoskr]], which seemingly dies just before she shows up, with her cryptic words signifying that she was responsible for it, she makes reference to the moon being unable to protect Juno from here and the disappears without a trace.
