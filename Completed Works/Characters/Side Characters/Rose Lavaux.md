# History
Nothing is known about Rose's past, however many hints throughout the story seem to indicate that she came from a much wealthier lifestyle, but threw it all away for the sake of her family. She lived together with her [[Autumn Lavaux|husband]] and two children [[Scarlet Lavaux|Scarlet]] and [[Maria]], she worked really hard to give them both a good upbringing but struggled due to poor financial circumstance and living conditions. She spent her days practicing piano and was seemingly quite adept at it. On the day that [[Stheno Roths]] came to invade [[Moonview]], she tried to defend her family with her life, and ultimately lost it doing just that. In her final moments, Rose exerted an unknown power from her body that was capable of killing Stheno and consequently ended [[History & Timeline|The Great Roths Massacre]].
