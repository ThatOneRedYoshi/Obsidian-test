# Profile
Ocean is one of the four puppet's that protects [[Maria]], it is a [[Magical Beings|magical being]] that seems to be created from from Maria's magic.

Unlike Maria's other puppets, Ocean does not represent one of her relatives and instead is a reflection of her past. Maria is shown to despise Ocean, often beating it out of frustration.
Ocean is shown to enjoy Maria's beatings and potentially enjoys pain in general.

## Weapon

Ocean’s weapon, Greed, is a large hammer created from mostly organic creature heads, the handle is made of a severed giraffe tongue allowing the hammer head to contort somewhat, the foregrip is made of a saber tooth tigers lower jaw bone, the head is created from an elephant skull with the tusks on the ends the back, the back end of the hammer has a shark mouth bone that’s teeth fire off when swung. Depending on the impact on each hammer swing the hammer would create a different Bass tone depending on the depth.

## Appearance
Ocean’s whole outfit is excessively over exaggerated with neon lights, it wears a funky leather jacket with see-through material across the arms, said jacket also has a pointless amount of zips because Ocean thinks they look cool, its bottom is a long neon dress reaching past the ankles and the shoes are a pair of neon trainers, it also has a large neon belt

Ocean is short (5,4)  small in stature with tanned peach coloured fabric, it’s quite nimble due to its small stature and constantly wears a smile on its face, it has rough skin and it has a black pixie cut hairstyle with faint blue fade

Ocean’s design is eccentric and unlike any of the other puppets. Ocean is the bubbly personification of the girl Maria deep down wishes she still was. Its exaggerated colours perfectly personify its over the top personality. Ocean’s bright colours contrast to Maria’s monochrome pallet, drawing attention to the part of herself that she lost.

# Personality
Ocean is excessively bubbly and acts rather childishly. She is extremely curious about all things and enjoys bothering Maria, much in the way a younger sibling would.
