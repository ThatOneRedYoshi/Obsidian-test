"The Balance" is an important being in [[Tomorrow's Reflection]].

# Profile
"The Balance" has appeared in many sections of Tomorrow's Reflection's history and is one of the most important forces in the world. It is responsible for both the creation of reality and also the laws of nature.
"The Balance" is described as a large eye with six sprouted wings all holding smaller eyes on their ends, each eye being a different colour. It speaks with seven overlapping voices.

# History
Hearing the wishes of [[Phoenix]] within the [[None-Physical Dimension]], The Balance created the known universe much like a god and gave Phoenix a physical form to traverse this world as he desired.
Along with the universe, it also created both [[Mayan]] and [[Chronos]] to act as embodiments for both space and time. After creating the universe, the Balance would disappear, not long after this would Phoenix discover that both signs of society and life existed before the creation of the universe, leading him to suspect "The Balance" might be obscuring some truths from him, as several thousands of years of history could be found buried throughout the land long before Phoenix arrived. Before Phoenix could find the answers however, "The Balance" came into battle with Chronos and Mayan, a fight which lasted several weeks and eventually concluded with "The Balance" being sealed away in the sun. Almost two millennia later, "The Balance's" power would be released into the world, causing what we refer to as the [[History & Timeline|Solar Disaster]].
