# History
Kara Xavier was born some time after [[Chronos]] and [[Mayan]] were brought into the world, very little is known about her upbringing, however it is assumed that she likely spent a great deal of it studying. At some point in her life she discovered a phenomena she called "[[Resources|Mana Veins]]", which were interconnected tunnels that burrowed under the earth, these tunnels often had unusual properties, and causing strange occurrences in the surrounding areas.
At some point, Kara met Chronos, who appears to have helped her with her research, somewhere along the line, either before or after this, Kara became infatuated with the studying of the mystical and magical, causing Chronos to share their true identity with them.
Kara wanted to learn to adapt magic to real world functions and to help humanity prosper. She created countless works and papers, however, there is little evidence to suggest she ever made any real progress before her death.
The only other thing that is known about her life is that she aspired to create an item of pure perfection, there is no evidence to suggest that she accomplished this however.
After her passing, her influence would not be felt until long after the [[History & Timeline|Solar Disaster]], when her work would be rediscovered and used by countless individuals to help progress society onward.
