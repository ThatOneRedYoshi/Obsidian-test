# Traditions
Traditional Moon Child attire consists of a black robe with red spots and patterns running down the sides depicting many diamond shaped eyes interconnected with one another. The robes are made from jaguar fur that has been dyed with the patterns mentioned above. They also wear a silver circle crest with an intricate pattern inside, the outer layer is made of a repeating square pattern with each containing a four pointed star with a black circle between each point, the middle layer consists of the same diamond eye pattern found on the robes, the middle has the image of a faced moon with closed eyes, with eyes running around its edges, each layer is cut off from each other by a circle.
Moon Children practices typically consist of sacrifice, initiation into the cult requires the sacrifice of one of the members eyes, this rule is void if the member is someone born into an already initiated family. Moon Children offer up human eyes to the moon as a sacrifice, with black, white, yellow, red and green eyes being the colours most targeted.
Moon Children worship in dark corners of the world, finding secluded places to pray deep into the night, typically out in the wilderness, they pray to the moon every night, and offer up sacrifices of eyes and blood on the 18th days of every month.
