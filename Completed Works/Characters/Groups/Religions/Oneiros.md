The Oneiros people are a religion found in [[Phoeba]].

# Description
The Oneiros people strongly believe in the power of knowledge, is a divine gift and thus pursue to preserve it. Though they call themselves a religion, they operate more as archivists, maintaining knowledge wherever they go.

# History
Before becoming a religion, many scholars in Phoeba would often pray and meditate during the night in the hopes of receiving divine visions of knowledge, a practice that actually worked many times, this caused word to spread as more and more people began to do it until it turned into its own religion.
The Oneiros people are often ridiculed by fellow scholars, as they are not allowed to cite "divine wisdom" as a source, so to archive their information the Oneiros people use the [[Shrine of Kulala]].

# Traditions
The Oneiros people do not have any special attire, however often wear a six petaled poppy earring in their right ear as they believe it will allow them to hear divine whisperings.
The people of the faith often go to the [[Shrine of Kulala]] to meditate, they sit with their legs crossed on a carpet with their bodies up straight as they clear their mind with the aroma of powerful incense that clears the mind of all senses and lets them focus purely in their pursuit of knowledge.
Outside of of the Shrine, the people of the faith also practice meditation in their own homes, typically before bed, this practice also helps them with both sleep and stress relief.
