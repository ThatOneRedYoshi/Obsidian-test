The Hadron Family is a [[Groups & Factions|group]] found in [[Tomorrow's Reflection]].

# Overview
The Hadron Family is the ruling family of the [[Hadron]] and [[Kariwa]] region. They are a political family that specialise in the field of magic. They were the first family to be appointed their own independent region by the [[Roths Family]].

# History
Starting out as a small family of miners, the Hadron's built their prestige with the discovery of countless valuable [[Resources]], their reputation and knowledge gave them an edge in political discussion on the topics and they managed to get a hold in the political scene, often challenging the [[Roths Family]] on many of their views. This gained them the respect of [[Gaia Roths]] who appointed them their own region, believing their fresh but safe views could bring about a positive change throughout the [[Collective Capital]] and its surrounding empire.
Their power only continues to expand to this day and though they are currently struggling financially their growth has been undeniably exponential.
