## Advanced Information
**Description**:He who cannot achieve the moon, does not deserve the sun, fixating on such can be blinding, only through the moon can our eyes truly grasp the light of what is beyond.

**Personality**:Juno is a cheerful, but somewhat reclusive individual. He was raised to make the most of life and always look on the bright side, he is very easy to get along with and loves socializing, even if he is insanely awkward. That said he also has a bit of a selfish side and can act indifferent to people he doesn’t deem worthy of his time.

**About Juno**:Loneliness and isolation often lead people to be mistrusting of people and fear closeness. Juno however is quite compassionate and is always trying to help people, he creates for the benefit of others but never able to create the thing he himself desires.

Juno is an innovator and a creative genius, his time is spent day and night creating and working on machines in an attempt to exceed his previous work. His work has led him to become quite famous in his field, attracting even the gaze of Athena Roths herself, to be handed an official award of progress and innovation. Such notoriety allowed Juno access to a larger assortment of materials and resources, in order to further his work. Juno’s work is quite evidenced to be innovative, almost too much so, is Juno really just one of the greatest minds ever born? Or is there something more going on unbeknownst to the young inventor? He isn’t sure how but he intends to find out, it seems for a genius, the phrase “Curiosity killed the cat” isn’t something to be considered.

## Relations
**Artemis**-He is incredibly intrigued at how he managed to not only create a sentient robot capable of rationally comprehending human emotion, but also how he was able to send it back in time over 50 years and gave it the power to manipulate time, he would love to experiment on her if he didn’t know the world may depend on her.

**Maria**-It was another bland day in Maria’s life during her time living in the Watchtower when Chronos brought home a guest, this wasn’t unusual for them as Chronos was quite social. Maria came down to greet this guest who happened to be this eccentric inventor by the name of Juno, Juno took a liking to Maria’s puppets and began pestering her about tinkering with them which lead to him visiting the Watchtower often, Maria and Juno grew a connection although this connection was very one sided as Maria found Juno to be incredibly annoying.
Juno treats Maria like a sibling, he teases her often and plays along with her angst.

**Chronos**-Chronos already knew exactly who Juno was prior to their meeting so their first interaction should have been insanely awkward… until Chronos realised Juno is just an awkward person anyways, Chronos introduced themself to Juno at one of his many tech expo visitations, Chronos being alive for as long as they have been gave Juno a long talk about old technology which Juno found very interesting, from there they became regular friends, Juno often visiting for dinner.

**Mardi**-They have a very deep distaste for each other's worldview but respect each other as futurists, Juno is a heavy believer in technology while Mardi believes magic is the way of the future.

**Verde**-Neither have any idea of the other's true identity and they only know each other from visiting idol shows together. This is helped by Juno always wearing a disguise when he is out on free time.
# Combat Information
## Weapon
Juno’s weapons, the Super Juno Punchers (SJP for short) are a pair of multi-layered oversized mechanical gauntlets designed himself, as such they look very mechanical and unprofessional, they come with a variety of features such as an internal superheating function which builds pressure on his other weapon, his large claymore the Juno Super-Sword (Name TBA) which at maximum pressure launches out at a high speed towards his opponent. The gauntlets as stated are heavily mechanical with various components sticking out such as heat rods, pipes, wires etc, as well as exposed pistons and joints. The sword is similarly is heavily over designed however unlike the gauntlets are not mechanical and are purely aesthetic, the sword is wrapped in things such as barbed wire and other metallic components, the only functional part of the blade aside from the sword itself is the pressurized internal heater that keeps the sword from immediately cooling off after being launched.

## Abilities
**Mechanical Mastery**-Juno has a complete understanding of all things metallic and mechanical

**Excess Endurance**-Juno has notably high endurance and stamina built up across his many encounters and fights with strong opponents, this allows him to shrug off otherwise painful injuries

**Understanding of Physics**-Juno understands practical physics to a high enough extent to build his contraptions with physics in mind
