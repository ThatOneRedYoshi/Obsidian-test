## Advanced Information
**Description**: In a world as ever-changing and relentless as ours, there is no room for things such as inaction or indecisiveness. One must follow their heart and resolve without question, lest they miss their chance at a happy ending. Pushing forward without even knowing where you’re going is the only real option, when the alternative is an empty void of sorrow.

**Personality**: Revenant when able to think clearly is an eccentric prankster with a streak of pessimism, she enjoys messing with others but her clumsy and careless nature also leads her to fear being a danger to others
When mindless Revenant is a bloodthirsty animalistic monster who acts purely on instinct and suffers from severe delusions.

**About Revenant**: Revenant hardly remembers her past, her name and everything she cares about have been reduced to mere concepts in her mind, she no longer knows where she's going or where she has been, but her heart is telling her to push forward even if the future might hold nothing for her.
Living life forever on the run for crimes she isn’t even aware she committed, Revenant lives a gruelling and strenuous life forever running and hiding while pushing towards a goal with seemingly no end, the only leads being the journal she keeps to push her in the right direction, if there’s a power strong enough to make her immortal then surely there must be one to reunite her with the only familiar face she remembers, whether that be in life or in death, Revenant will stop at nothing, pushing herself ever onward to reach that goal. Never again will she allow herself to fail due to her inability to act.

## Relations
-Due to her poor memory and degrading mind, Revenant is no longer able to form any connections or memories of people and is only able to form basic concepts and ideas to memory

# Combat Information
## Weapon
Revenant’s main weapon of choice is their circular chainsaw, Barbershop, a weapon tailor made for intimidation and violent combat, Barbershop unlike regular circular saws has an extended bridge similar in appearance to a regular saw which the blade can travel across at fast speeds, increasing and decreasing the reach of the saw, additionally, Barbershop can also fire off reserve saws across the bridge at fast speeds acting as projectiles. Barbershop's body is relatively normal however has a small compartment underneath designed to fit an old sawed off shotgun modified to fire small metal shrapnel out at their target and pierce deep into the body damaging bone structure, the trigger for this shotgun is found on a the chain used to rev the saws and operates as a small button on the section you grab. In addition the chain has two weighted anchors which can be swung as a medium range blunt melee option.

# Design Information
## Outfit
Revenant wears dark alternative clothes with an excess of chains and belts wrapped around and hanging off the sides. Revenant's top is a black crop-top that has a blue meander pattern running across the neckline, wrapped underneath is a black belt with chains running through the top and bottom. Running down her neck is a chain necklace that holds a large black rock encasing a golden coin portraying a horse with no head. Wrapped around her neck is a red choker made of spider lilies with small rocks hanging from the stems. Around her waist is a deep blue leather coat that drapes equally, the back side parting perfectly like wings with the sleeves that wrap it around her falling equally down her waist. Running across her arms are netted sleeves coiled in tight thick metallic chains wrapped around her arms like a snake connected to the studded bracelets around her wrists, the top of her arms as well as her legs marked with a deep red tattoo in the shape of spider lilies with her legs also wearing fishnets down to her ankles, at the end of the fishnets is two more studded bracelets with chains connected to her heavily ornamented blue boots covered in metallic patterns and chains falling from the sides held down by more black rocks. Finally her skirt is a black gothic style skirt, waistline wrapped in the same meander pattern as her top line with thirteen small metal chains hanging all around extending down to the knees, each one weighed down by blue painted rocks in the same shape as her necklace.

## Appearance
Revenant is a short (5,3) woman with average definition, she wears her hair down keeping it curly and a little messy, her hair fades from black to blue quite drastically as it goes down, her eyebrows are quite thick and bushy, she wears a notable amount of makeup especially thick blue eyeshadow and deep red lipstick with a light about of eyeliner and painted blue nails, she also has piercings on her nose and ears. Finally she has the mark of the necromancers tattooed onto her lower back which due to having a visible lower torso can be seen in her design.

Revenant’s design comes from a variety of inspirations all rooted in 1980s and Y2K alternative fashion, her colours use an excessive level of black with thick blues as her primary colour and reds here and there to accent her pallet, the excessive use of accessories is also an intentional part of her design, the chains and skulls on her design are meant to link to her necromancer roots and the clothing design is meant to be reminiscent of the sort of clothes worn by teenagers often in old slasher movies, her overpowering colour pallet is also highly important. Her design is also intended to feel rebellious and anti-authority.
