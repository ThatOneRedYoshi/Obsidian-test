## Advanced Information
**Description**: Eyes that reflect the starry sky above, calling it down unto those lost in the depths, her light guiding the lost to a dawn yet to rise. The stars will lead us all home, but the sun will only lead us astray, let our eyes rest in darkness, lest the moon seize our spirits.

**Personality**: Voila is a shy but kind-hearted individual, they try to be outgoing but often struggle with it, with that said the few people they can talk to they hold very dear to them, she is very selfless always putting others before herself, even at times when it may be a detriment to her.

**About Voila**: Fighting against raging tides, Voila watched at the world around her hardened, while she failed to adapt. She will pursue her ideal through her own means even if all are to laugh at and ridicule her for such childish fantasies. The morning star will guide the world to a new day, so let us leave yesterday behind, and fret not for tomorrow, for even should the night consume us, we still have this moment.

Voila is a kind soul who does not have any one place to call home, like the waves, she drifts from place to place, bringing with her a gentle breeze as she passes. Like the ocean, some fear her, the deep unknown that rests within her leaves many feeling uncertain, however, the ocean will always be there, flowing back and forth against the shore, and Voila will always be there to lend her aid to those who need it. As a survivor of a devastating war, Voila knows what its like to feel helpless, she would not wish that upon anyone, and so chooses to selflessly lend herself to all those she is able.

## Relations
**Mardi**-Mardi was the first person Voila ever befriended on the surface and as such was very naïve and open with her, fortunately Mardi was not a malicious person and did not use any of this against her, even trying to help her be more careful with what she does and does not tell people. The two have a very close bond and their motives to make the world a better place only strengthen that more
Mardi is the only person Voila can truly put all her trust and faith into, their goals align perfectly as such they spend a great deal of time together, they’re often found together doing small good deeds to help the general public just a little bit all while their grand plan to bring the world together one small step at a time falls into place.

**Maria**-Voila met Maria through their shared hobby of stargazing, Maria was not easy to get along with but Voila was very persistent in her efforts and eventually got her to crack and talk a bit, though she doesn’t talk much Voila thinks of her as a friend.
Voila takes a great deal of pity on Maria, not out of any form of relatability or selfish desire but simply because she cares about Maria, though she is often called naïve by her peers for associating with such a girl Voila considers Maria to be a genuine friend though she may never know if Maria reciprocates that feeling to her

**Ghoul**-Voila was the first person Ghoul met upon awakening from her ‘death’ the two find a lot of relation in each other both being outcasts by the general public. Voila once offered Ghoul to join her and Mardi in the endeavours however Ghoul declined for reasons unknown. 

**Pandora**-She’s naïve but even Voila knows that Pandora isn’t quite trustworthy, though she still thinks everyone deserves a fair chance and treats her in the same friendly way she treats everyone else, it even appears to be working as Pandora has next to no animosity towards her the way she does to more or less everyone else

**Nymph**-Nymph invited Voila to join the WSP, an offer she would have accepted as their aspirations are the same, however unfortunately their methods are worlds apart, Voila wants peace for everyone whereas Nymph is heavily against any second chances for the formerly deceased, as such though they have no active hostility to each other they both know their truce is only a ticking time bomb before one side has to stand up to see whose view is more just.
They can only hope that when that day comes the other side will turn a new turn and join the other.

# Design Information
## Outfit
Voila has two variations of her outfit depending on whether she is in Siren or Human form. In both forms she wears a frilly, off-shoulder blouse cropped around her stomach area, it has detached sleeves with frilly cuffs with feathers coming off of it and drapes that extend own from the elbow, both the sleeves and top are coloured in a gradient starting out as a pastel pink extending down to a pastel blue, it is covered in white star patterns all across. The drapes of the sleeves extend down, they are the same gradient colours as the top with a similar pattern to the top, the end of the drape has a sun pattern, around her neck she also wears a beaded necklace with a twelve pointed star pendant. With her human form, in place of where her tail would be she wears a blue skirt that extends down to her ankles with an intricate geometric pattern at the bottom and light blue high heels with a ribbons on either side just under each ankle with a clip attaching the ribbons to the shoe of an upside down star.    

## Appearance
Voila is physically average in height and body (5,8) with a slight but noticeable amount of muscle in her arms, she has a light tan on her face with a mole on her left cheek and ruby red eyes, she has a large mermaid tail that has a fading blue pattern, getting darker as it reaches the bottom, covered furthermore in glittery star patterns. Additionally there is cut sections on several parts of the ends of her fins, giving them a more triangular shape. She has triangular shark-like teeth and wears a thin amount of pink and blue eyeshadow. She has two tattoos, a hand tattoo depicting the constellation of Pisces and a back tattoo depicting an upside down star. Finally, her hair is blonde, medium length, with pink highlights around the bottom.

Voila's design is intended to be a little misleading, her design seems friendly on the surface but there are small red flags all across that indicate something is a little amiss. Predator like aspects such as her shark teeth are extra indicators of this.
