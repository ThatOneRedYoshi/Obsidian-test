**About Mardi**:

## Relations
**Juno**-Mardi first encountered Juno at Mardi’s college, despite their small age gap and similar intellectual prowess Mardi was a student while Juno was renowned as one of the greatest minds of his time, a high level of jealousy arose in Mardi and ever since then she has held onto this jealousy, their first real encounter was a chance encounter just outside of the capitol when Juno was fighting off some Lusii, Mardi just so happened to be studying the wildlife nearby and took it upon herself to kill the Lusii instead, this is where their rivalry began.

**Voila**-Mardi and Voila have been quite close ever since they met, their friendship is quite strong and although they disagree a lot they have a strong connection nonetheless, they spend a lot of time together and their goals align well.
After Voila helped Mardi attain the Uasivi Vatu, Mardi turned her into a human, an exchange that seemed fair in Mardi’s eyes.

**Nymph**-For Mardi, Nymph was a hate on sight type of person, their opposing worldviews mixed with clashing personalities meant the two were destined to dislike each other, this hate however mostly stems from Mardi and Nymph can hardly remember her name the majority of the time.

**Ghoul**-Often-times Mardi is urging Ghoul to let her study them, however unsurprisingly Ghoul refuses, outside of this however they have a solid friendship even though they are so far apart in lifestyle, Mardi met Ghoul once when studying outside of the capital, their first encounter was one of hostility and confusion but after both managed to get their bearings on the situation Ghoul was quite inviting to Mardi within their space and even helped her with her studies by acting as a tour guide of sorts.
# Combat Information
## Weapon
Mardi’s weapon Magnum Opus is a golden multi-formed wand that can switch between three differing forms. Opus is designed to channel Mardi’s magic in a controlled manner as although she does not need it to use magic it makes it far easier for her to control.

**Speculum Magicae**-Opus’ standard form takes the shape of a small handheld golden wand with a star shaped frame for the head, inside of the star is Opus’ core a red coral gemstone which collects and stores Mardi’s mana for use later, Mardi uses this in her Magos form, it is an offensive weapon style that is used for combat magic.

**Baculus Stellarum**-Opus’ second form takes the shape of a long two-handed golden staff with a crescent head and Opus’ core hovering atop which absorbs the mana of incoming attacks, Mardi uses this in her Magissa form, it is a defensive weapon used for self defense and attack reflection/absorption.

**Orbita Galaxia**-Opus’ third form takes the shape of a golden sun frame rotating around Opus’ core, Mardi uses this in her Neraida form, it rapidly boosts Mardi’s mana and is used for evasive magic.

## Abilities
**Transformation**-Mardi can transform between three different forms, Magos, Magissa and Neraida, using her magic infused gemstone Opus, these forms have no physical effect on her outside of her appearance however allow Opus to control infused abilities in different ways.

**Power Copy**-Mardi can copy the powers and magic of anyone with weaker mana than her, she can then create more powerful versions of these spells though at the cost of vast amounts of mana.

**Mana Drain**-Mardi can drain the mana from a target and infuse it in herself with a physical touch, draining mana does not allow her to copy abilities of people who would otherwise have a higher mana capacity to her.
