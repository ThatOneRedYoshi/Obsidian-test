## Advanced Information
**Description**: Fate and gambling are one and the same, we are all dealt the hand we are given. To control the cards is to control fate itself, however, the puppets' kin does not sit in the dealer's chair.

**Personality**: Pandora is a chaos lover and notably eccentric, she only seeks out things that entertain her. She loves to gamble and trick people into impossible games.

**About Pandora**: Born amongst chaos, the faker knows not how to be human, pretending to exist, a second nature to her. She knows neither who nor what she is, forever haunted by guiding visions of light. But the girl knows only to act; fate does not interest her. 

Pandora was “born” into the Roths family when her box was discovered deep inside the castle treasury. Upon being awakened by Athena Roths through opening said box roughly two years before the events of the main story, she was adopted into the Roths family by Athena, showing face publicly as her adopted sister. Pandora knew Athena had ulterior motives with this but she did not really care, she was only interested in entertaining herself. Pandora would spend her days skipping around the castle, annoying the guards and maids that worked there, keenly aware that they could not say a bad word in response. One day Pandora got sick of such a boring life and decided it was time to depart, embarking on a journey of her own. From here she became a bit of a wanderer, journeying all over the capital in her ever-growing pursuit of self-fulfilment

## Relations
**Maria**-Pandora derives great joy from tormenting Maria, but much differently from other people she torments, for Pandora finds Maria’s personal hatred of her to be incredibly amusing, Pandora’s relationship with Chronos only boosts this feud that the two of them have. With that said Pandora has an insatiable and unexplainable urge to protect Maria from danger should she ever have to, the reason for this is unknown even to her but she never really gave it any thought, perhaps it’s because she cares too much for Chronos, or possibly something entirely different.

**Chronos**-Pandora and Chronos’ relationship is that of an extreme but friendly rivalry, they act like two really old friends who have known each other for generations, they joke and jab at each other one day and be best friends on the other.

**Athena**-Despite no longer being together, the two hold no ill-will towards each other. Pandora still holds a deep care for Athena and still considers her family in some way, however, their clash of lifestyles meant that the two were destined to distance themselves.

**Voila**-Pandora and Voila met by chance during one of Pandora’s little bored adventures, Voila was insanely oblivious to Pandora’s general malice and treated her far too kindly for even Pandora to torment her, as such Pandora visited her a few times after out of curiosity.
Though they have only met a handful of times Pandora gets an uneasy feeling around this seemingly kind-hearted girl, perhaps her kind-heart is too much of an opposite to Pandora’s chaotic and generally malicious personality, or perhaps there is something more than what meets the eye with her.


# Combat Information
## Weapon
Pandora’s weapon is her mysterious box, a small silver box just big enough for her hand to fit inside of, it has an intricate snake pattern wrapped around it with two rubies for the eyes, inside the box is unperceivable but it appears that the box can contain more or less anything though what comes out of it is always a mystery

## Abilities
**Mastery of Illusion**-Pandora has a complete mastery of illusions and mind tricks and can deceive more or less anyone with ease, only the strongest minds can resist her tricks

**Chaos**-Pandora has the theoretical ability to mess with all reality, though her control over this is heavily limited and often has random effects

# Design Information
## Outfit
Pandora wears a black and white robe-like dress with a variety and sophisticated patterns on and gold supporting accessories, towards the bottom of the dress appears to be made of pure white feathers, she has a large variety of gold jewellery including necklaces, hair clips and rings. She also wears a broken black crown on her head with gold imbued into it

## Appearance
Pandora’s physical form is that of an average height woman (5,6) with a pale complexion, she is proportionally slender especially in spite of her height, she has vibrant blonde long hair with various layers to it. Pandora is best described as angelic in appearance, possessing a pair of tattered angel wings and being conventionally good-looking, notably Pandora can take on any form she wants to this is only a preferred form. Her meta-physical form is seen differently by anyone who actually sees it however it usually takes on a form of the perceiver's natural desires, if their desire was money for example the form they perceive would likely be that of a wealthy individual.
Pandora’s design is entirely built around the concept of being a trickster and being deceptive, the broken angel design was chosen to represent the broken ideology of purity she sees herself as, the colour pallet is very monochromatic and “pure” using only gold-yellows as a supporting colour to further emphasis that purity

- Pandora had her crown crafted not long after leaving the Glaspalast, the material it was made of was not resistant to her magic however, causing it to break and blacken in colour.
