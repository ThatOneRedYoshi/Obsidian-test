## Advanced Information
**Description**: A girl adrift in a lonely ocean never to love again, an ambition of only vengeance. Will she be able to cut the strings binding her to the past or will she forever be puppeted by her emotions?

**Personality**: Maria is a cold and not easy to get along with type of girl, being perpetually young means she is also perpetually angsty and angry, the only people she is willing to talk to are her puppets and Chronos. Maria is also known to be quite manipulative, lying to people and emotionally manipulating them as she sees fit, a talent that is made easy by her stagnant personality.

**About Maria**: Once a bright burning fire, extinguished by rage and hatred, Maria threw away desire and love in favour of seeking revenge, but anger only blinds and deludes, Maria will pursue an unachievable dream of revenge until the remaining sparks of her humanity burn out, and then she will be left completely alone, as not even death will bring back what she once had.

Maria lives with Chronos, the individual who kindly took her in after awakening one hundred years after her supposed death alongside her family at the hands of Stheno Roths. Life with Chronos is calm and quiet, a stark contrast to the lively energetic household she grew up in, Maria is left relatively undisturbed by Chronos, she is quite accustomed to this loneliness as no bond she could create will ever return to her the joy she used to have, Chronos respects her wishes to be alone and does not pester her more than needed, however Maria has an unhealthy habit of sneaking out of the house from time to time in her pursuit of vengeance and thus Chronos has to intervene, this tradition replays every few days or so in a vicious cycle of scolding and ignoring, between the times of these rituals Maria is studying on her magic and testing her own endurance, her behaviour is self-destructive and irrational but her blind sighted hunt for revenge will not be halted by trivial factors like rationale or self care.

## Relations
**Juno**-It was another bland day in Maria’s life during her time living in [[The Watchtower]] when [[Chronos]] brought home a guest, this wasn’t unusual for them as Chronos was quite social. Maria came down to greet this guest who happened to be this eccentric inventor by the name of [[Juno]], Juno took a liking to Maria’s puppets and began pestering her about tinkering with them which lead to him visiting the Watchtower often, Maria and Juno grew a connection although this connection was very one sided as Maria found Juno to be incredibly annoying.
Juno treats Maria like a sibling, and despite Juno being alive for more years than Maria, she refuses to allow him to treat her like the younger one, often stating “I’m a hundred years older than you dog boy” and getting very aggressive towards him when he does so. Dog boy is a recurring quote from Maria to belittle Juno who air-headedly does not realize it is being used as an insult.

**Pandora**-She is a pain in Maria’s side, always tormenting her in some way, though this seems playful to most people Maria sees right through her malicious intent, Maria hates the fact her and Chronos get along.
Maria often refers to [[Pandora]] as the unwanted aunt of the family, given Pandora and Chronos’ relationship being somewhat like siblings.

**Chronos**-Maria cares for nobody aside from Chronos, Chronos is like a parental figure or older sibling to Maria, and Maria, despite never admitting it, would do anything for Chronos. Though Maria has no idea who Chronos really is, she holds them very dearly to her heart. Maria is often sneaking away from home, Chronos is very aware of this but always lets Maria get away with it for a little while before scolding her later, Maria does feel somewhat guilty about it but continues doing it anyway because even the only person she truly cares about can’t stop her from accomplishing her goals.
Maria has no insults for Chronos

**Voila**-Maria can only at worst feel neutral about her, Voila is way too kind-hearted for even Maria to hate her, Maria also sees a bit of her old self in Voila and given that she is a fellow survivor of the [[History & Timeline|The Great Roths Massacres]] Maria has some level of trust in her, Voila often shows up to see Maria when time permits it which Maria always begrudgingly amuses.
Maria has no insults for Voila

**Athena**-It should go without saying but Maria wants nothing more than to “tear Athena’s fake glass heart from her chest and crush it beneath the palm of my hands” or at least that’s what she vows to herself every night. Maria’s only life motivation is to ruin Athena and her family in the worst way possible, but if Maria succeeds in this goal, what else is left for her in life?
Maria has an unimaginably long list of vulgar and non-repeatable insults for Athena

# Design Information
## Outfit
Maria dresses in a similar fashion to a doll, with a frilly black dress complemented with a black ruffle on her chest centred with a silver pendant, alongside a much larger black ribbon on her back casting a bat-like silhouette, one final bow tied to the back of her head peeking over the top like cat furthering the dark pallet with black leggings and heeled boots with ribbons around the back. Maria has a black choker with a silver crescent moon engraved in the middle, additionally she has a crescent moon hair clip and wears sharp, black painted acrylic nails
Maria’s various silver accessories as well as nails alternate colours depending on her active puppet.

## Appearance
Maria is a short (5,3) unassuming and relatively frail girl, she is incredibly pale with messy, curled charcoal hair with sharp bangs. She is perpetually tired with bags under her eyes and wears thick silver and black fading eyeshadow. she is very malnourished which only contributes to her fragility, her right streak in her hair is also white and notably longer than the rest of her hair, it changes colour depending on the active puppet. Her left hand has the constellation of Scorpio tattooed over her hand and finally she has strings coming from her fingertips which are used to control the puppets. Maria’s most notable visual trait is her void black pupils that are devoid of colour of expression.

Maria’s design takes inspiration from ‘french and ‘lolita’ fashion styles, with heavy frills and elegant flows, her design is meant to feel like a masquerade, a poor girl acting like a princess almost. Her dark and bland colours are meant to represent her inability to express herself, the only colours on her being ones that represent other aspects of herself and that much like an actor, can be changed to fit her current environment
